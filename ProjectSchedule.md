# ProjectSchedule.md
This file contains the proposed schedule and the time estimation for this project.

# Parts to be completed:
- Problem analysis, i.e. reading the provided problem document
- Design, i.e. Design what classes should be included, and how the designed classes interact with each other
- Implementation, i.e. the actual coding implementation of the designed classes
- Testing and verification, i.e. using the program and finding defects
- Documentation, i.e. document each class and its uses, UML class diagrams, to illustrate class usage

# Estimated required time
(In reality, these phases would overlap with each other, rather significantly)
## Problem analysis - 30mins
## Design - 3hrs
1. Menus, and traveling from menus to menus - 30mins
2. Managing user inputs - 30mins
3. Functionalities for each menu - 1hr
4. Identification of needed helper classes - 30mins
5. Organization of packages - 30mins

## Implementation - 12.5hr
1. Menu transversal - 3hrs
2. Functionalities for individual menus - 6hrs
3. Helper classes implementation - 3hrs
4. Output formatting - 30mins

## Testing and verification
- Finding problems and fixing - varies

## Documentation - 2hrs
1. README.md - 1hrs
2. MANUAL.md - 1hrs

# Estimated Time of completion - 18hrs
